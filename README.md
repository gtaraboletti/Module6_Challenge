There seem to be higher prices per square foot near the water. The highest price per square foot, as well as the highest rents, tend to be on the Southern side of the city. **Question:** What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?	**Answer:** # I would my company that now is the time to invest if they are going to. The prices per square foot are down from previous years, and the gross rent has increased. I would recommend they look for neighborhoods where the average number of housing units is increasing while the price per square foot is decreasing. These are likely neighborhoods where there is an increasing supply that has outpaced demand. However, as the areas are developed more and new business move into the area, demand will increase, driving up prices and rent. South Beach and Forest Knolls would be good places to invest in. These are areas where the price per square foot is lowest. If and when these areas develop, because in a city like San Fransico, it is only a matter of time, they stand to earn the greatest return on their investment as opposed to buying property in an already developed and thriving neighborhood. ## Contributors ##Giselle TarabolettiUNCC FinTech Boot Camp## License ##MIT LicenseCopyright (c) [2021] [Giselle Taraboletti]Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
